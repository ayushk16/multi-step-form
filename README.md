## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Root variables in css
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

1. How can we use objects and arrays to make our forms updated at each and every step to make it more user friendly.
2. Also we can give dynamic values like prices to our plans and add ons, set what plans and addons should be preselected on user page.
3. I've used functional programing in javascript.
4. Different DOM manipulation practices.
5. And many more good codding practices.

### Continued development

1. Using localstorage to store dynamic objects and keep them stay there to auto fill user prefrences.

2. Using react to make page more smooth and more light for browser

### Useful resources

- [mdn docs for javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) - This helped me building knowledge about various javascript concepts.
- [w3 schools for css](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp) - This helped me building knowledge about css properties like flex, display, positioning, etc.
- Rest i've googled.
